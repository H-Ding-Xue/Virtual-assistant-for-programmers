A website developed using HTML; CSS; JS; Python Flask and Sci-Kit Learn with the purpose of helping developers code and learn more efficiently
My role in this project was to train two models. The first model would take in pseudocode as user input and translate it into actual python code. The second model would analyze a block of python code provided as user input and generate comments for that block of code.
